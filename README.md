# template-bundlib

My awesome library built using [Bundlib](https://github.com/manferlo81/bundlib)

## First steps

### Name and description

The `"name"` and `"description"` fields in `package.json` are missing, make sure to include them before you publish your package.

### Changelog library name

Edit `.versionrc.json` `"header"` field to use the name of your library for CHANGELOG generation

### Choose a license

I DID NOT include a license in this project as it is intended to be used as a template. Generate a LICENSE after you create your project, don't forget to declare it using your `package.json` `"license"` field.

### Before publishing

Make sure to remove your `package.json` `"private"` field declare your GitHub `NPM_TOKEN` secret before publishing your package

## LICENSE
